# ProMan---task-organizer-web-application
In this project me and my group have created a web application that allows you to organize tasks. Our main task was to create a frontend in JavaScript fully connected with our backend and database. Thanks to the above, we learned:

create an advanced Flask project,
understand the practical usage of AJAX,
web development, 
plan the development of an advanced product.

We also deployed our app on Heroku. The link is below:
